# JSM REST API

## Created by : Tanvir Khondakar

## Description

This is a Node JS and Express JS CRUD REST API made in order to understand the concepts of a REST API and the CRUD principal. It allows a person to create, edit and delete users from a mock database. It also uses the UUID module to give each user a unique ID in order to practice its use case for an actual application.

The application was made possiable with the help of JavaScript Mastery's toutorial on REST APIS. You can find the toutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8WPWK9mS5M

## Installation

In order to build this application you will need Node JS and Express installed. Additionally you will need an application like POSTMAN in order to run some of the backend functionality

## Usage

While this is simple API for practice purposes you can easily connect it with a Database and use the code in order to create your own API.
